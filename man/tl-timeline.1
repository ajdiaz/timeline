flag will mark the events that are trusted.
.SH FILTER
.PP
The filters are a way to simplify the output of the timeline.
Filters allows you to discard or show events according to some
criterias.
In general a filter is really a list (white-separated) of criterias.
The following criterias are available:
.TP
\f[B]tag:<tag>\f[R]
Show (or hide if you are using the filter in
\f[I]timeline.filter.hide\f[R]) the events with the tag \f[I]tag\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]score-min:<score>\f[R]
Show (or hide) events with almost \f[I]score\f[R] points.
.TP
\f[B]score-max:<score>\f[R]
Show (or hide) events with no more than \f[I]score\f[R] points.
.TP
\f[B]view:<view>\f[R]
Show (or hide) events that match the specific view.
Read \f[B]tl-view\f[R](1) for more information about views.
.TP
\f[B]text:<string>\f[R]
Show (or hide) events that match with the specified text.
You can use shell globs here, like \f[I]*\f[R] or \f[I]?\f[R], but not
regular expressions.
.TP
\f[B]mention\f[R]
Show events that mentions you, using the user name that you provided to
your account.
Please note that if someone mentions you with different name this filter
is useless.
.SH INDEX
.PP
Every event displayed in the timeline will be prefixed (according to the
format configured) with a sequential number called \f[I]index\f[R].
The index allows you to refer to an event easily, without need to know
the OID of the event (EID).
.PP
Read the \f[B]tl-tutorial\f[R](7) to learn how to use the index number
or discover the EID of an event.
.SH FILES
.TP
\f[I]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tl/config\f[R]
The main configuration file for timeline.
.TP
\f[I]$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tl/.timeline.index\f[R]
The file where the last generated index is kept.
