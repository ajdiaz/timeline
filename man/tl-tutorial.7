tl-tutorial - A tutorial for new users in Timeline
.SH SYNOPSYS
.PP
\f[I]tl\f[R] *
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This tutorial explains how to start with Timeline, how to create new
account or clone a previously existing one, follow other accounts, how
to post, reply, etc.
.SH CREATING OR CLONING ACCOUNT
.PP
There two different ways to start to use Timeline.
The first one is creating a new account, and the second one is cloning a
previosly created one.
.PP
In the following examples we will create a local account named
\f[I]myaccount\f[R].
The name is how you can identify your account to manipulate it or in
timeline display, but keep in mind that this name is only for you.
.SS Creating new acccount
.PP
This is recommended way to use if you own your git repository server.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl account create myaccount push_url pull_url
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[I]push_url\f[R] and \f[I]push_url\f[R] are the respective pull
and push url grabbed from your public repository.
.PP
Optionally you can add your public GPG key id to the config, to sign
every post that you do, executing the command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl account keyid 0xffff
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[I]0xffff\f[R] is your GPG key id.
.SS Clonning for remote repository
.PP
This is the recommende way for a public store repository, To create a
new account you must keep in mind that you need a public[1] git
repository.
You can use your own server (see \f[I]Creating new account\f[R] above)
or create a public account in one of the many public services that
exists for that[2].
Once you created your public repo just grab the pull and the push url
(the pull one usually is HTTP/GIT while the push usually is SSH).
Then execute:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl account clone myaccount push_url pull_url
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Where \f[I]push_url\f[R] and \f[I]push_url\f[R] are the respective pull
and push url grabbed from your public repository.
.PP
Optionally you can add your public GPG key id to the config, to sign
every post that you do, executing the command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl account keyid 0xffff
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Rebuild from config
.PP
This option is intended to use when you accidentaly remove your local
copy of the the account.
To restore from config just type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl account rebuild myaccount
\f[R]
.fi
.SH FOLLOW OTHER ACCOUNTS
.PP
To follow other accounts you need to known the pull URL for them.
You can discover this URL using a couple of mechanism, please read
\f[B]DISCOVERING NETWORK\f[R] section and the \f[B]DIRECTORY\f[R]
section.
.PP
Once you known the pull URL, just follow the account running the
command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl follow add pull_url myfirstfollow
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will add the account pointed by \f[I]pull_url\f[R] and internally
you will name this account as \f[I]myfirstfollow\f[R].
Please note that this name is internally for you, and cannot be the same
that other user use for the same account.
.SH SEE YOUR TIMELINE
.PP
The timeline is the list of all events what happened to you and to the
accounts that you follow.
To see your current timeline just type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl timeline refresh
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or use the abbreviated form:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl tr
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
As you can notice, this command need to refresh the timeline, pulling
changes from all accounts that you follow.
If you only want a quick view, and you do not need the latest events,
you can display the latest cached version doing
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl timeline list
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
or also, with an abbreviated form:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl tl
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the output you will find something like that (it depends of your
output format, which you can change editing the config, please read
\f[B]tl-config\f[R](1) for know more about formatting).:

\f[R]

.PP
Here is a more detailed explanation of the fields:
.TP
\f[I]Index Id\f[R]
This is a temporary index which is generated each time that you display
the timeline.
This index will allow you to reply or interact with other post more
easy.
Read the section \f[B]POST AND REPLY MESSAGES\f[R] below to find out who
the index id can help you.
.TP
\f[I]Date and time\f[R]
No need more explanation, just the date and time of the post.
By design Timeline does not support more that one message per second in
the same account.
The format of the date, as also the entire line is configurable via
\f[B]tl-config\f[R](1), please read also \f[B]tl-timeline\f[R](1) to
known more about how to format lines and dates.
.TP
\f[I]Username\f[R]
Is the username of the owner of the post.
If the account has a familiar username then we will use it, if not then
use the account OID which is, sometimes a ver unconfortable large
number.
See \f[B]tl-user\f[R](1) to know more about how to set familiar names to
accounts.
.TP
\f[I]Flags\f[R]
Flags are special indicators for the event.
The first character indicates if the post is signed or not (see
\f[B]tl-timeline\f[R](1) for known all posibles values of this
character).
The second character indicates if the event has any tag and the third
one if the event has any reply.
.TP
\f[I]Score\f[R]
Show the score of the event.
To know more about scores, please read the \f[B]SCORES\f[R] section in
\f[B]timeline\f[R](7).
.TP
\f[I]Message\f[R]
Need no explanation, just the message.
Some words can be highlighted.
If you want to know more, please read \f[B]tl-timeline\f[R](1) man page.
.SH POST AND REPLY MESSAGES
.PP
Post and replies are the core of any Timeline communication.
To post a new message just type:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl event post \[aq]your post message\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or an abbreviated form:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl p \[aq]your post message\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will post the message \f[I]your post message\f[R] in your timeline
account.
.PP
To reply an event, you need to use the command \f[I]reply\f[R] in the
following form:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl event reply num \[aq]the reply message\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or an abbreviated form:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl r num \[aq]the reply message\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This command will reply the event identified by \f[I]num\f[R] with the
reply text \f[I]the reply message\f[R].
This \f[I]num\f[R] is the index id that you can get when doing a
\f[B]timeline list\f[R] command, see above the section \f[B]SEE YOUR
TIMELINE\f[R] for more information.
.PP
Aditionally you can use the flag \f[I]--eid\f[R] to use instead of the
index number the event OID of de message to reply.
Read \f[B]GET POST INFORMATION\f[R] below to learn more about how to
inspect the events and get the OID.
.SH TAG AND SCORE
.PP
Timeline add two new features to the social network world.
The tagging and the score.
.SS Tags
.PP
A tag is a label that a user can publicy define over an event.
This is not just a hashtag in the usual way.
A tag is defined with other users not by the owner of the post (well, in
fact the owner can also set tags on this owns events).
You can filter your messages to see only certain tags or discard
messages with some tags (see \f[B]tl-timeline\f[R](1) to see how to do
this in deep).
.PP
For example you can view the messages related with vim:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl tl tag:vim
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that because tagging is over the control of the owner, some people
can tag badly the event to gain impressions.
This does not work very well on timeline, because you can tag as
\f[I]spam\f[R] the bad tag, and then ignore the tags \f[I]spam\f[R] from
your list.
.SS Scores
.PP
The score is a numeric value for an event.
You can think to the score like a \f[I]like\f[R] in other platforms.
But you can give also a negative score.
The score value is always +1 and -1, you cannot give more than one point
per account.
.PP
Of course you can filter messages using scores:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tl tl min-score:10
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This example will shown only events with more than 10 points.
By default negative messages will be ignored.
.SH GET POST INFORMATION
.PP
You can inspect the event using the command \f[B]tl event info\f[R],
followed by the event index in the timeline.
.PP
This command will show you more information about the event, including
the event Id.
The OID of an event is an unique identifier for this event in the entire
network.

.SH NOTES
.SS [1]
.PP
Actually a private repository is also allowed if you want.
Does make not much sense, since only authorized users can clone your
repo, but anyway there is the option.
.SS [2]
.PP
For example https://sr.ht, https://gitlab.com, https://codeberg.org,
https://github.com, among others.
