.SH NAME
.PP

.SH SYNOPSYS
.PP
\f[I]tl-config\f[R] {list|get|set|save|edit} {args\&...}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manage the configuration of Timeline.
This command has a number of subcommands depending of the action to do.
Each subcommands has its own parameters:
.TP
\f[B]list\f[R]
List all configuration settings
.TP
\f[B]get\f[R] <key>
Retrieve the value of the specific key.
.TP
\f[B]set\f[R] <key> <value>
Set a new configuration value or reset a previous one.
.TP
\f[B]save\f[R]
Dump the configuration settings to file
.TP
\f[B]edit\f[R]
Open a editor (using environment variable \f[I]$EDITOR\f[R]) to edit
manually the config file.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
The configuration file is saved a git config file.
There a number of configration keys which are explained in the proper
man page.
For instance \f[I]network\f[R] keys will be explained in
\f[B]tl-network\f[R](1), while generic ones are explained in
\f[B]tl\f[R](1) man page.
.SH FORMAT
.PP
The \f[I]tl\f[R] tool uses a very customizable printing mechanism to
output the message in commands like \f[I]timeline\f[R] or
\f[I]network\f[R].
Messages are formated in the configuration files, and explicit keys are
explained in the proper man page of the command.
But there are some general key suffix:
.TP
\f[I]<key>.format\f[R]
Set the output format.
The output format is a \f[B]printf\f[R](1) format, which usually
includes \f[I]%b\f[R] for color codes and \f[I]%s\f[R] for strings, but
some fields can also be casted to more comples output, like dates, for
example a date can be casted with \f[I]%Y-%m-%d\f[R] using the usual
\f[B]strptime\f[R](3) format.
.TP
\f[I]<key>.fields\f[R]
Se the files to be printed using the format specified in
\f[I]key.format\f[R], the value must be a comma-separated list of
fields, for example \f[I]date,name,user\f[R], the fields will be
expanded according to the format in the proper order.
Each key must defined the fields that this configuration support, so
fields for \f[I]network\f[R] could be different that fields for
\f[I]timeline\f[R], for instance.
If you are curious about how format works internally check the source
code file \f[I]src/format\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]<key>{.|-}color-<field>\f[R]
Set the color number to be used for the specific field.
For example \f[I]network.follower-color-date\f[R] set the color for the
field \f[I]date\f[R] of the output \f[I]follower\f[R] for command
\f[I]network\f[R].
Color numbers depend of your terminal capabilities.
Check ANSI Color codes supported on your terminal.
The color must be a pair, comma separated, indicate the foreground in
the first term and the background in the second one, if missing use the
default value.
See \f[B]FORMAT EXAMPLE\f[R] below.
A special value for color is accepted: \f[I]CONSISTENT\f[R] which will
use the same color (but a random one) for each item.
.TP
\f[I]<key>{.|-}style-<field>\f[R]
Set the font style for the field.
Default value is \f[I]normal\f[R], but \f[I]underline\f[R] and
\f[I]italic\f[R] are valid too.
Your term must support this kind of capabilities.
See \f[B]tput\f[R](1) man page to test it.
.SH FORMAT EXAMPLE
.TP
\f[I]network.list.format\f[R]=`%b%s%b %b%s%b %b%s%b'
Set the format for the network list, which consist in three fields, all
of them accept a color (the \f[I]%b\f[R] key before and after the
\f[I]%s\f[R] will be replace by the proper color.
.TP
\f[I]network.list.color\f[R]=`7,'
Set the default color, in this case use foreground color 7 (white) and
use default background (none set).
Note the comma indicating the the background term is missing.
.TP
\f[I]network.list.fields\f[R]=`date,name,url'
Set the fields to be displayed.
In this case the fields \f[I]date\f[R], \f[I]name\f[R] and \f[I]url\f[R]
in this exact order.
The name of the fields must be supported by the command, in this example
\f[B]network list\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]network.list.color-date\f[R]=`3,'
Set the color for field date to foreground 3 (yellow).
Keeping all the other fields to the default color setting in
\f[I]network.list.color\f[R] parameter above.
.TP
\f[I]network.list.style-name\f[R]=italic
Put the field name in the output in italic font (if the terminal support
it).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIALES
.TP
\f[I]EDITOR\f[R]
The editor used in \f[B]edit\f[R] subcomand to edit the configuration.
If not present use \f[I]vi\f[R].
