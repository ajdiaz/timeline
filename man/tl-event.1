.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]tl-event\f[R] command is the main command of Timeline.
You can publish post, replies, tags or scores in your timeline as also
inspect other people events.
.PP
Events, posts, replies, etc.
are not the same thing.
If you have a mess with these terms, please read \f[B]TERMINOLOGY\f[R]

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.PP
The \f[B]event\f[R] command allows the following subcommands and its
respective arguments:
.TP
\f[B]post\f[R] [\[en]encrypt <user> | \[en]encrypt-anon <user>] <message> [<tags>+]
Post a new message in your timeline, if configuration option
\f[I]account.auto-push\f[R] is set to \f[I]true\f[R], then also will
push the change to the public repository.
A \f[B]message\f[R] could be any UTF-8 encoded text, including emojis,
or any other unicode stuff.
Additionally, you can tag your post in the same step.
Message used in post will support \f[B]ABBREVIATIONS\f[R].
If \f[V]--encrypt\f[R] or \f[V]--encrypt-anon\f[R] are present, the
event will be posted encrypted.
See \f[B]tl-crypto\f[R](7) for more information about how crypto works.
.TP
\f[B]reply\f[R] [--eid] <num/eid> <message> [<tags>+]
Post a message as reply of the specific event.
The source event to reply can be identified by an EID (i.e.\ the unique
identifier for a message that you can get via \f[B]info\f[R] command),
or easier, using the index number that you can see when do a
\f[B]tl-timeline\f[R](1) \f[I]list\f[R] command.
Additionally, you can tag your post in the same step.
Message used in reply will support \f[B]ABBREVIATIONS\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]tag\f[R] [--eid] <num/eid> <tags>+
Tag an event with specific tags passed as arguments (white-space
separated list).

like in \f[I]reply\f[R], as explained above.

.SH ABBREVIATIONS
.PP
Message used in post and reply will be parsed and some symbols can be
replaced by others.
We call these abbreviations.
For instance, you can add an abbreviation using the \f[I]abbr\f[R]
command (see \f[I]tl\f[R](1)) to create an abbreviation \f[I]:lol:\f[R]
to be replaced by \f[I]:-D\f[R].
.PP
Since version 1.9 Timeline support emojis natively, so no specific
abbreviations are required.
Just enable it using configuration setting \f[I]input.emojis\f[R] to
\f[I]true\f[R]
.SH CONFIG SETTINGS
.TP
\f[I]input.emojis\f[R]=\f[I]false\f[R]
if true support natively emojis.
Symbols like \f[I]:love:\f[R], or \f[I]:smile:\f[R] will be replaced by
the proper emoji code.
You can use the \f[I]abbr\f[R] command to list all.
