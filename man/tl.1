.SH BASIC CONCEPTS
.IP \[bu] 2
Timeline is designed to be distributed, which means that there is no
main server which store all the accounts like other networks.
.IP \[bu] 2
Because of the distributed nature you need to discover new friends using
\f[B]tl-network\f[R](1) or \f[B]tl-directory\f[R](1).
.IP \[bu] 2
You will only see the events of the people that you follow, nothing
else.
There is no way to print advertising to you (unless an account that you
explicitely follow do the advertising.
In this case you can also use tags and scores to mark that event as spam
(read \f[B]tl-event\f[R](1) and \f[B]timeline\f[R](7) for more
information).
.IP \[bu] 2
Timeline is designed for hackers, so you do not expect something
fancy\&... well it has colors (because everyone loves colors) and
unicode characters, include emojis (because everyone needs emojis to
communicate).
.IP \[bu] 2
Because you only see the accounts you want to see, only what these
accounts says about the others (that you also follow) is relevant.
This means that don\[cq]t matter than 1 million people tag a post like a
spam, you will only considerer spam if any of the people that you follow
mark this post as spam.
You don\[cq]t care about other opinions.
.SH TERMINOLOGY
.TP
<account>
An account for Timeline is a git repository with specific format (see
\f[B]timeline\f[R](7) for full explanation of the protocol).
Usually the account is a repository with write permissions, but could be
also a read-only account.
.TP
<event>
A record in a Timeline account, could be a \f[B]reply\f[R], a
\f[B]tag\f[R], a \f[B]post\f[R] or a \f[B]score\f[R].
.TP
<follow>
A follow(ing) is an account that it\[cq]s followed by you, where you are
another account.
.TP
<post>
A record in a Timeline account which contains a message ownered by the
account and no related with anything else in the Timeline network.
.TP
<reply>
A response to a previos Timeline event.
.TP
<score>
A score (+1 or -1 points) over a previous Timeline event.
See \f[B]timeline\f[R](7) for a full explanation about scores.
.TP
<tag>
A tag over a previous Timeline event.
See \f[B]timeline\f[R](7) for a full explanation of why tags are
implemented and for what tags could be used.
.TP
<timeline>
The result of mixing all messages of the account plus the messages of
the accounts that the first account follows.
.TP
<user>

Account names are hash identifiers which are difficult to remember.
An user is an arbitrary name for an account which makes the account easy
to remember and easy to identify by you.
