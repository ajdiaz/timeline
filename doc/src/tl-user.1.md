# NAME

tl-user - Manage your user names for accounts


# SYNOPSYS

*tl-user* [\<name\> \<account oid\>]

# DESCRIPTION

Users are custom name for accounts. An account is identified by a large OID
generated by hash fuction (read more about this in **tl-account**(1) and
**timeline**(7)). You usually want to use a human name for those. The
*tl-user* command allows you to do that.

If *tl-user* is called without arguments, it will display a list of configured
users.

To set a new user name, just pass the desired *name* as first argument, and the
account OID as the second one.

You can delete the user name via **tl-config**(1) command
